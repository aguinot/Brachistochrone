    "I sincerely hope you will enjoy this course as much as I did while writing it. I tried to tackles the subject with various approaches within the limits of what jupyter notebooks can offer. Some parts are interactives and visuals, others are more textual and intuitives. Ideally, I would have added even more interactions and animations, even some games or quizz for example. At first, I also planned to write a part where the user interacts with some bits of codes, since it becomes more and more accessible and very informative for physics problems. But that would greatly increase the prerequisites for this course to be accessible. Anyway, I hope that this glimpse of my ideas will entertain you.\n",

The reader is strongly invited to read one hint at a time before trying to answer again, going back and forth between the questions and the solutions. Try to do as much as you can by yourslef. The internet is also your friend for extra knowledge. Even when the whole solution is given, do not hesitate to redo the reasoning from the beginning, to check if you completely understand.

    "Legends say that on another planet, similar to ours, some cities are built up in the sky. The houses and small neighbourhood are isolated on **floating rocks**, connected by cables and bridges. Apart from the mysterious mechanism that makes islands fly, the physic there is similar to ours, here on earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Akara lives on one of these floating islands, and she would like to deliver packages via a roller-coster to her friend Bonogonzo which lives just a little further down on another island. She constructed a unique tubular structure filled with vacuum and very slippery walls. When a parcel is sent, no initial push is given, and it simply slides down the track under gravity pull, without any friction. However, she would like to know which shape to give to the rail in order to minimise the time a package takes to arrive to her friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation is pictured here after. But wait! Do not play the video yet. Akara's island is up left, while Bonogonzo's island is down on the right. Three different rails are showed: the first one simply follows a **straight** line (orange); the second adopts a very **steep** curve at the beginning, and flat at the end (green); the third path (red) go **deep** under Bonogonzo's island level before going up. As you may have guessed already, the goal <p style=\"color:red;\">the goal of what ? On dirait juste que tu parles de la prochaine question, alors qu'en fait c'est le but du cours en entier</p>\n",
    " is to select the fastest route... or deduce and construct a better one, or even **the best route**! Does it exist? And if so, does it depends on the mass of the object? \n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "  - Intuitively, we can see that **as a package fall, it gains speed**. The lower it is in relation to Akara's island, the faster it goes along the rail.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "  - Although the **straight** line is the **shortest** distant, is it by far the **slowest**. The trajectory is a rough compromise between going toward Bonogonzo's island and going down to gain speed, and clearly, success is not there. The package looses too much time at the beginning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "  - On the contrary, the first instants on the **steep** curve are spent going down as fast as possible to gain speed, then use this speed to go to the right and reach destination.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "  - Finally, the **deep** curve chooses to go rather deeply, maximising the velocity for a moment, before reaching Bonogonzo's island. This last approach is actually the **fastest**.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have our intuitive solution! The curve which is the fastest should find a **compromise between reaching high speed by going down, while still spending some time going toward B's island**. Keep in mind that this is only an intuitive solution. We do not know the exact relation between the height and the speed of the object. In physics, intuitions  are generally a good starting point, but don't get too much sentimentally attached to them. Sometimes they can be completely misleading and prevent us from moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only the beginning of the story. Believe it or not, Akaras's questioning is a famous problem in physics which leads to beautiful and multiple theoretical and experimental demonstrations. We will explore some of them.\n",

Knowing that the counterweight is raised 3 meters above its rest positioin before firering, and supposing that the trebuchet is a perfect machine able to completely convert the gravitational potential energy of the counterweight into kinetic energy of the projectile. Can you find the velocity of the projectile the moment it exits the trebuchet and start flying in the air? What if the counterweight mass is divided by four?

The most common one is to compute the **derivative** of the function, noted $f'(x)$ or $\\dfrac{\\text d f(x)}{\\text d x}$, then find for which value of $x$ the derivative vanishes: $f'(x) = 0$. Intuitively we can understand it like this: the derivative of the function at point $x$ is **the slope** of the function at that point. The only point where the slope is null is at the bottom of the valleys (minima) or at the top of the hills (maxima). Therefore, looking where the derivative vanishes is equivalent to looking for those minima and maxima.\n",

Yes, light speed varies depending on whether it travels thought air, ice, water, or vacuum. Strangely, each time light goes from one to another, it changes direction following the law of refraction. It is **as if light tries to travel in the least possible amount of time**.
